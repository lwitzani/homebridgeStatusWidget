I try to list the changes i make in this changelog:

#16.10.2023 13:00
- switched the source URL for the homebridge logo because the file does not exist anymore at the old location

#16.11.2022 20:00
- added support for iOS16 lockscreen widgets (they are much more smaller)
- there are now more properties persisted in the CONFIGURATION. The old config is migrated.

#15.01.2021 17:35
- just added pretty-printing for the json files (as requested)

#1.12.2020 21:21
- fix for issue when json was not downloaded from icloud yet (also for the json files now...)

#26.11.2020 17:00
- small fixes nothing special
- your existing config file can be used with this update (configuration class did not change yet)

#21.11.2020 12:00
- major improvements for customization -> tried to put everything in the configuration (which is persisted) -> this unfortunately means your old config is not compatible anymore so it will be deleted and recreated (sorry)
   - now basically almost everything is settable by you: shown all texts, textcolor, chartcolor, icons, iconcolor ... etc
   - refactoring of status panel (top right area) -> now you can change the shown text and RE-ARRANGE the status columns so that they align perfectly again after the text changed (you must play around with the values here)
- support for custom light/dark mode (set bgColorMode to CUSTOM and adaptToLightOrDarkMode to true and change the customBackgroundColorX_light and _dark as well as the fontColor_light and _dark as well as chartColor_light and _dark)
- added special gui that is shown if you run this script with siri shortcut -> this gui shows a list of all (not ignored) software that has an update
- added voice feedback when running the script via siri BUT this seems to be bugged atm (i wrote the developer of Scriptable about it. Maybe this doesn't work as i expect it should)

#19.11.2020 22:26
- hope you can figure out how to use the configuration :) :
- added support for persisting and loading configurations -> now you can configure everything once as you like, create a configuration.json file, save it in e.g. iCloud and from there you can easily use this file via a widget parameter and don't have to think about reconfiguring everything after updating the script itself
- the new parameter must have the form USE_CONFIG:yourfilename.json (so it starts with USE_CONFIG: and ends with .json. The middle part can be chosen by you)
- tried my best to make this as stylable as possible
- support for dark and light versions of purple and black (can be set automatically)
- you can now set chart color, font color, set own background colors and more
- added x axis label for charts
- did a pretty large code refactoring without function changes
- added support for Homebridge Config UI X Authentication Mode 'none' -> so if you chose 'none' and don't need credentials to show your UI in the browser, you now don't need it for this widget anymore
- new screenshots

#17.11.2020 22:08
- complete overhaul of the section above the updated date and below the title for perfect alignment (now only using stacks and spacers)
- only updated one picture (the main pic on top of readme)
- no functionality changed

#17.11.2020 20:31
- just added a new background color BLUE_TO_RED

#17.11.2020 20:14
- added missing reset of notification state (not critical), so that notifications are fired again after everything was back to normal (e.g. HB down -> notification, HB up again -> reset, HB down -> again notification)
- you can also get notified now when a state changed back to normal (but is disabled by default)
- now if temperature is unknown -> it is not shown at all
- added possibility to ignore plugins, Homebridge or Node.js during checking for updates
  - for plugins, enter their npm name (e.g. 'homebridge-fritz') as string in the given empty array 
  - for Homebridge enter 'HOMEBRIDGE_UTD' and for Node enter 'NODEJS_UTD' in the empty array

#16.11.2020 22:24
- added support for entering credentials via widget parameter
- parameter must have the format like admin,,mypassword123,,http://192.168.178.33:8581
- added some concrete error information that should help setting up the widget
